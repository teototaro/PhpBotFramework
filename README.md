$start_command = new PhpBotFramework\Commands\MessageCommand("start",
    function($bot, $message) {
        // Reply with a message
        $bot->sendMessage("Hello, folks!");
    }
);

$bot->addCommand($start_command);

// A shortcut for message commands.

## Documentation
Check the [documentation](https://danyspin97.github.io/PhpBotFramework/) for learning more about PhpBotFramework.

## FAQ

- **Why we don't implement asynchronous requests?**

   We use [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) in order to fire HTTP requests to Telegram Bot API.

   Unfortunately it doesn't implement real asynchronous requests but **a sort of**.

   Take a look to [this issue](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/1127) for more information.

- **Why there isn't a `chat_id` parameter to pass for API methods?**

  PhpBotFramework is "smart" enough to set it as the current user, group or channel ID.
  Most of the frameworks out there requires you to specify the chat ID for every method's call but PhpBotFramework does it for you calling most API methods on the current chat.

  You can still change it by using [setChatID](https://danyspin97.github.io/PhpBotFramework/group__Bot.html).

## Examples

You can find a list of examples bot right in `examples/` folder.

All examples listed here are fully functional: you only need a valid **Telegram bot token**.

## Made with PhpBotFramework
- [MyAddressBookBot](https://github.com/DanySpin97/MyAddressBookBot): [Try it on Telegram](https://telegram.me/myaddressbookbot)
- [Giveaways_Bot](https://github.com/DanySpin97/GiveawaysBot): [Try it on Telegram](https://telegram.me/giveaways_bot)

## Testing

PhpBotFramework comes with a test suite you can run using **PHPUnit**.

You need to set `MOCK_SERVER_PORT` environment variable which tells PhpBotFramework
on which port run the **mock server** that allows the tests to be executed.

```shell
export MOCK_SERVER_PORT=9696
```

Now you can run the run the mock server:
```shell
./start_mock_server.sh
```

And run the test suite:
```shell
php vendor/bin/phpunit
```
